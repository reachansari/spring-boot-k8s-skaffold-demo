Deploy springboot application in kubernetes using skaffold.

## [Prerequisite / Libraries used](#Prerequisite)
* Docker and kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* Spring Boot
* Spring Configuration
* Spring REST Controller
* Skaffold

## [Skaffold](#skaffold)
Skaffold is a command line tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes-native applications. Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines. This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster.

*  skaffold.yml is used by the Skaffold CLI
*  k8s-deployment.yml & k8s-service.yml are used for deployment into the K8s cluster and they are integrated into the skaffold.yml for continuous deployment

## [Compilation command](#compilation-command)
```mvn clean package -DskipTests```

## [Execution command](#execution-command)
```skaffold dev``` : To build and deploy your application every time your code changes.

```skaffold run``` : To build and deploy your application once.

## [API end-points](#API-end-points)

- GET -> `http://localhost:30143/hello` - This prints "Welcome to Skaffold".

## [Uninstall kubernetes objects for spring-boot app](#uninstall)

```CTRL + C``` : To stop the spring-boot app.

```kubectl delete service spring-boot-k8s-skaffold-demo```: To delete the kubernetes service object.
